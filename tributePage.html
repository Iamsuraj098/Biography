He was born to a very poor Tamil Muslim family. His father was a boatman, and an imam in a local mosque, and his mother was a housewife. Due to poverty, Dr. Abdul Kalam had to sell newspapers in his early childhood to run his family, but he was a hardworking and sharp student. He started his schooling from Schwartz Higher School in Ramanathapuram. He then moved on to complete his graduation in physics from the University of Madras and after that to study aerospace technology from the Madras Institute of Technology.

                2002, Dr. Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India. He had received the title of "People's
                President". During his tenure as President, he had rejected the mercy plea of the Dhananjoy Chatterjee,
                convicted of brutal rape and murder. He was only the third President to be awarded the Bharat Ratna. He
                also imposed President's rule in Bihar in 2005. However, he did not file for Presidency for a second
                term and instead returned to the field of academics and continued to do so till his death in 2015.
